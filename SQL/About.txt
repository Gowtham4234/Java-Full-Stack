What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored electronically. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Databases are essential in various applications such as websites, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and more.



Understanding Relational Databases

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns. These tables are related to each other based on common attributes, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.



Key Concepts in Relational Databases:

Tables: In a relational database, data is stored in tables. Each table consists of rows and columns. Rows represent individual records, while columns represent attributes or fields.



Relationships: Relationships establish connections between tables based on shared data. The most common type of relationship is the foreign key-primary key relationship, where data in one table refers to data in another table.



?Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them.

Importance of Relational Databases
Relational databases offer several advantages:

Data Integrity: They enforce data integrity through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

Flexibility: Relational databases allow for complex queries and support various data types, enabling versatile data manipulation.

Scalability: They can handle large volumes of data and accommodate growth by scaling horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (upgrading hardware).

Security: Relational databases offer robust security features to protect sensitive data, including access control, authentication, and encryption.



Conclusion:

Understanding databases and relational databases is fundamental in today's data-driven world. Relational databases like MySQL provide powerful tools for storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently. In the next sections, we'll delve into MySQL specifically and explore its features and functionalities.

By mastering basic commands and SQL syntax, you can effectively manage databases and tables using the MySQL CLI. In the next sections, we'll explore advanced MySQL concepts such as data types, constraints, and advanced SQL queries.

Creating and Managing Databases and Tables
Creating Databases:

In MySQL, you can create a new database using the CREATE DATABASE statement followed by the desired database name. Here's how you can create a new database:

    CREATE DATABASE database_name;

Replace database_name with the name you want to assign to the new database. Make sure to follow naming conventions and avoid spaces or special characters.

Example:

    CREATE DATABASE my_database;



Managing Databases:

Once a database is created, you can perform various operations such as selecting, dropping, and altering databases.

Selecting a Database:  To work with a specific database, you need to select it using the USE statement:

USE database_name;



Dropping a Database: To delete a database and its contents, you can use the DROP DATABASE statement:  

   DROP DATABASE database_name;

Exercise caution when using this command, as it permanently deletes all data in the specified database.

Creating Tables:
Tables are used to store data in a structured format within a database. You can create a new table using the CREATE TABLE statement. Here's the syntax:

CREATE TABLE table_name (

    column1 datatype constraints,

    column2 datatype constraints,

    ...

);



Replace table_name, column1, column2, etc., with the appropriate names and data types for your table columns. You can also specify constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and not null constraints. 



Example:

Let's create a simple table named users with columns for id, name, and email:



?

Creating Tables:
Next Step
In this example

id is an integer column with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute, which automatically assigns a unique value to each row.

name is a variable character column with a maximum length of 50 characters and is marked as NOT NULL, meaning it cannot be empty.

email is also a variable character column with a maximum length of 100 characters and is marked as UNIQUE, ensuring that each email address is unique within the table.

Managing Tables:

After creating a table, you can perform operations such as altering, dropping, and renaming tables.

Altering a Table: You can modify the structure of an existing table using the ALTER TABLE statement.

Dropping a Table: To delete a table and its contents, you can use the DROP TABLE statement.

Renaming a Table: To rename a table, you can use the RENAME TABLE statement.



Conclusion:

Creating and managing databases and tables are essential tasks in MySQL database administration. By mastering these operations, you can effectively organize and store data in your MySQL database. In the next sections, we'll explore data types and constraints in MySQL, which further enhance the structure and integrity of your database.

Introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language)
What is SQL? Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data from databases.



Key Concepts of SQL:

Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, and indexes.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate data within tables, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Data Control Language (DCL): Used to control access to data within the database, including granting and revoking privileges.



?

SELECT statement and basic queries
SELECT Statement Syntax: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It has the following basic syntax: 

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name;

Example: 

SELECT first_name, last_name

FROM employees;



?

Filtering and sorting data
Filtering Data with WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on a specified condition.

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

WHERE condition;



Sorting Data with ORDER BY Clause: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. 

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC, column2 ASC|DESC, ...;



?

Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
Aggregation Functions:

COUNT(): Returns the number of rows that satisfy the specified condition.

SUM(): Returns the sum of values in a numeric column.

AVG(): Returns the average of values in a numeric column.

MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.

MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column



Syntax:



SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;



?

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
GROUP BY Clause: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.

HAVING Clause: The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on a specified condition.

Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count

FROM employees

GROUP BY department

HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;



?

Introduction to subqueries
Subqueries: A subquery is a query nested within another query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.

Example:

SELECT first_name, last_name

FROM employees

WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1700);



Conclusion: SQL is a powerful language for managing relational databases. Understanding the basics of SQL, including the SELECT statement, filtering, sorting, aggregation, and subqueries, is essential for performing data manipulation tasks effectively. In the next modules, we'll explore more advanced topics such as data manipulation in MySQL, indexing and optimization, stored procedures and functions, security and user management, and advanced topics.

15. Using JOINS to retrieve data from multiple tables

16. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN

17. Advanced JOIN techniques

INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
INSERT Statement: The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) to a table.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)

VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

DELETE Statement: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table.

DELETE FROM table_name

WHERE condition.



UPDATE Statement: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. 

UPDATE table_name

SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...

WHERE condition;



DELETE Statement: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table.

DELETE FROM table_name

WHERE condition;



?

Transactions and ACID properties
Transactions: A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It ensures data consistency and integrity by either committing changes to the database or rolling back the changes if an error occurs.



ACID Properties:

Atomicity: Ensures that all changes within a transaction are completed successfully or rolled back if any part of the transaction fails.

Consistency: Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.

Isolation: Ensures that transactions are executed independently of each other, preventing interference between concurrent transactions.

Durability: Ensures that changes made by committed transactions are permanent and survive system failures.



?

Using JOINS to retrieve data from multiple tables
JOINS: Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

Example:

SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name

FROM orders

INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;



?

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN
INNER JOIN: Returns rows from both tables that have matching values in the specified columns.

LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no matching rows are found, NULL values are returned for the right table columns

RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If no matching rows are found, NULL values are returned for the left table columns.

FULL JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, combining the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.



?

Advanced JOIN techniques
Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in a combination of every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

Self Join: Joins a table with itself, typically used to compare rows within the same table.

Non-Equi Join: Performs a join operation using a condition other than equality (e.g., greater than, less than).



Conclusion: Data manipulation in MySQL involves performing operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting records from tables. Understanding transactions, ACID properties, and various JOIN techniques is essential for effectively manipulating data across multiple tables. In the next modules, we'll explore indexing and optimization, stored procedures and functions, security and user management, and advanced topics.

23.Introduction to stored procedures and functions

24. Creating and executing stored procedures

25. Input and output parameters in procedures

26. Creating and using user-defined functions

27. Triggers and events in MySQL

Introduction to stored procedures and functions
Stored Procedures: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database catalog. It can accept input parameters, perform operations, and return results to the calling program.



Functions: A function is a subroutine stored in the database catalog that accepts parameters, performs computations, and returns a single value. Unlike stored procedures, functions are designed to return values rather than perform operations.



?

Creating and executing stored procedures
Creating Stored Procedures: You can create a stored procedure using the CREATE PROCEDURE statement.

Syntax: 

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name

   [IN|OUT|INOUT parameter_name data_type,...]

BEGIN

   -- SQL statements

END;



Executing Stored Procedures: Stored procedures can be executed using the CALL statement or by invoking them from within other SQL statements.

Syntax: 

CALL procedure_name(parameters);



?

Input and output parameters in procedures
Input Parameters: Input parameters are used to pass values into a stored procedure for processing.

Output Parameters: Output parameters allow stored procedures to return values back to the calling program.



INOUT Parameters: INOUT parameters can be used for both input and output, allowing values to be passed into the procedure and returned back to the calling program.

Example: 

CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee(IN emp_id INT, OUT emp_name VARCHAR(50))

BEGIN

   SELECT name INTO emp_name FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;

END; 



?

Creating and using user-defined functions
Creating User-Defined Functions: You can create a user-defined function using the CREATE FUNCTION statement.

Syntax:

CREATE FUNCTION function_name (parameters)

RETURNS data_type

BEGIN

   -- SQL statements

   RETURN value;

END;



•Using User-Defined Functions: User-defined functions can be used in SQL queries just like built-in functions.

•Example: 

CREATE FUNCTION calculate_discount (price DECIMAL(10,2), discount_rate DECIMAL(5,2))

RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)

BEGIN

   DECLARE discounted_price DECIMAL(10,2);

   SET discounted_price = price - (price * (discount_rate / 100));

   RETURN discounted_price;

END;



?

Triggers and events in MySQL
Triggers: A trigger is a set of SQL statements that are automatically executed in response to specific events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table.

Events: Events are tasks scheduled to execute at specified intervals or times.



Example:  

CREATE TRIGGER audit_trigger

AFTER INSERT ON employees

FOR EACH ROW

INSERT INTO audit_table (event_type, event_time) VALUES ('INSERT', NOW());



?Conclusion: Stored procedures, functions, triggers, and events are essential components of MySQL for encapsulating business logic, automating tasks, and ensuring data integrity. By leveraging these database objects, you can improve code modularity, reduce redundancy, and enhance database performance. In the next module, we'll explore security and user management in MySQL.

32. Best practices for database security

MySQL user authentication and authorization
User Authentication: MySQL uses various authentication methods to verify the identity of users attempting to access the database server. These methods include native MySQL authentication, LDAP authentication, PAM authentication, etc.

User Authorization: Once authenticated, MySQL determines the privileges (permissions) assigned to the user, which dictate what actions they can perform on databases, tables, and other objects.



?

Managing user privileges
Granting Privileges: You can grant privileges to users using the GRANT statement.

Syntax: 

GRANT privileges ON database_name.table_name TO 'username'@'host';



Revoking Privileges: To revoke privileges from users, use the REVOKE statement.

Syntax:

REVOKE privileges ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'host';



Viewing Privileges: You can view the privileges assigned to users using the SHOW GRANTS statement.

Syntax:

SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';

?

Securing the MySQL server
Securing the Server: To enhance security, you can implement various measures such as:

Using strong passwords for user accounts

Limiting network access to the MySQL server

Enabling encryption for data transmission



Regularly updating MySQL server and client software

Configuring firewall rules to restrict access

Monitoring and auditing database activities



?

Backing up and restoring databases
Backing Up Databases: You can back up databases using the mysqldump utility or MySQL Enterprise Backup.

Syntax (mysqldump): 

mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_file.sql



Restoring Databases: To restore a database from a backup file, use the mysql command-line client or MySQL Workbench.

Syntax (mysql):

mysql -u username -p database_name < backup_file.sql



?

Best practices for database security
Best Practices:

Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary privileges to users.

Use strong, unique passwords for user accounts and rotate them regularly.



Regularly update MySQL server and client software to patch security vulnerabilities.

Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

Implement multi-factor authentication for added security.

Monitor database activity for suspicious behavior and potential security breaches.
