Spring Boot
Spring Boot
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

Introduction
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".



We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

Features
Create stand-alone Spring applications.
Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files).
Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration.
Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible.
Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.
Spring Boot Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Spring Framework. Our Spring Boot Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.


Spring Boot is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring framework.


Our Spring Boot Tutorial includes all topics of Spring Boot such, as features, project, maven project, starter project wizard, Spring Initializr, CLI, applications, annotations, dependency management, properties, starters, Actuator, JPA, JDBC, etc.?
Next Step
Along with the Spring Boot Framework, many other Spring sister projects help to build applications addressing modern business needs. There are the following Spring sister projects are as follows.



• Spring Data: It simplifies data access from the relational and NoSQL databases.

• Spring Batch: It provides powerful batch processing.

• Spring Security: It is a security framework that provides robust security to applications.

• Spring Social: It supports integration with social networking like LinkedIn.

Spring Integration: It is an implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns. It facilitates integration with other enterprise applications using lightweight messaging and declarative adapters.



Advantages of Spring Boot
• It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be started using Java -jar.

• It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.

• It provides opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.

• It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.

• There is no requirement for XML configuration.

• It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.

• It offers the number of plug-ins.

• It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.

• It increases productivity and reduces development time.

Limitations of Spring Boot
Spring Boot can use dependencies that are not going to be used in the application. These dependencies increase the size of the application.

Goals of Spring Boot
•The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time.



• Provides Opinionated Development approach

• Avoids defining more Annotation Configuration

• Avoids writing lots of import statements

• Avoids XML Configuration

Prerequisite of Spring Boot
• To create a Spring Boot application, following are the prerequisites. In this tutorial, we will use Spring Tool Suite (STS) IDE.



• Java 1.8

• Maven 3.0+

• Spring Framework 5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT

• An IDE (Spring Tool Suite) is recommended

Spring Boot Features
• Web Development

• SpringApplication

• Application events and listeners

• Admin features

• Externalized Configuration

• Properties Files

• YAML Support
